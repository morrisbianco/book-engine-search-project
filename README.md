### Description
For this project, I was tasked to finish an application that searches for any book on the Google Books API. When you have logged in, you will be able to save the books you searched for into your saved books database. To do this, I started by reworking all of the server code

After the questions, you can open the html in the browser and see the information you put in displayed through a series of cards. If you click on the github link, it will open that github account in a new tab. If you click on the email, it will start an email draft to that email account.

### Usage
To use this application, you need to open the project in the terminal and run node app to start the prompts. After you answer each prompt, your choices will be added to the team.html in the output folder. If you open this html in the browser, you will see cards of all of your team members and their information. 

This video will show a step-by-step guide to how this is done. <a href="https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/video/4100862?key=af12a5b954e078b14d925e0a7babf2aa">Video Guide</a>
